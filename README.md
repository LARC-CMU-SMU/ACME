Our work is an extension of [im2recipe](https://github.com/torralba-lab/im2recipe-Pytorch), where you can borrow some food data pre-processing methods.

## Installation
We use pytorch v0.5.0 and python 3.5.2 in our experiments.  
You need to download the Recipe1M dataset from [here](http://im2recipe.csail.mit.edu/dataset) first.

## Training
Train the ACME model:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py 
```
We did the experiments with batch size 64, which takes about 12 GB memory.


## Model for Testing
Test the model:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py
```
Pre-trained models can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1svtpy-sD4pcaFfLGQNGaPIVjrKr-lhsT?usp=sharing).
